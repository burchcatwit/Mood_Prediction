## Project Overview
Building upon my previous project: [SEND/RETURN: A simple, multiplayer audio experience powered by content-based song recommendations] (https://github.com/Siberian-Breaks/SEND-RETURN) this project aims to better predict/categorize the mood of a song, to better dictate the post-processing effect of SEND/RETURN's virtual environment. Currently, the project relies on the Spotify API's audio features, such as valence: >A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).*
